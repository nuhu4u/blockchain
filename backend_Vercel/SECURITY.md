# Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures and checks that should be performed before and after deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### Smart Contract Security
- [ ] Code has been audited by a professional security firm
- [ ] All test cases pass with 100% coverage
- [ ] Access controls are properly implemented
- [ ] Reentrancy guards are in place where needed
- [ ] Integer overflow/underflow protection is in place
- [ ] Emergency stop/pause functionality is tested
- [ ] All external calls are validated and secured

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date and free of known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Environment variables are properly secured (not committed to version control)
- [ ] API keys and credentials are stored securely
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for all public endpoints
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced

## Deployment Security

### Key Management
- [ ] Private keys are stored securely (hardware wallet recommended for production)
- [ ] Multi-signature wallets are used for contract ownership
- [ ] No private keys are hardcoded in the codebase
- [ ] Key rotation policy is in place

### Contract Deployment
- [ ] Contract is deployed from a secure, private network
- [ ] Constructor parameters are verified before deployment
- [ ] Contract is verified on Etherscan/Block Explorer
- [ ] Contract ownership is properly transferred if needed

## Post-Deployment Security

### Monitoring
- [ ] Contract events are being monitored
- [ ] Unusual activity alerts are set up
- [ ] Regular security scans are performed
- [ ] Incident response plan is in place

### Access Control
- [ ] Only authorized addresses have admin privileges
- [ ] Privileged functions are properly restricted
- [ ] Emergency contacts are documented

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Smart Contracts
- [ ] Reentrancy
- [ ] Front-running
- [ ] Timestamp dependence
- [ ] Integer overflow/underflow
- [ ] Denial of Service (DoS)
- [ ] Unchecked return values

### Web Application
- [ ] SQL Injection
- [ ] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- [ ] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- [ ] Insecure Direct Object References
- [ ] Security misconfigurations

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Monitor for unusual activity
2. **Containment**: Pause contract if necessary
3. **Investigation**: Identify the root cause
4. **Eradication**: Fix the vulnerability
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Review**: Document lessons learned

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use established libraries and frameworks
- Keep dependencies updated
- Implement comprehensive logging

### Operations
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing
- Security training for team members
- Regular backups

### Key Management
- Use hardware wallets for production keys
- Implement multi-signature schemes
- Regular key rotation
- Secure key storage
